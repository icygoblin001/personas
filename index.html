    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The interface I chose was the bench press, a piece of exercise equipment commonly found in gyms. The bench press is used to train one's upper body,
        targeting the chest, tricep, and shoulder muscles.

    <ol>
        <li><b>Bar:</b> The interface's main character, user moves this up and down</li>
        <li><b>Plate Holders:</b> Store plates of varying weights and sizes</li>
        <li><b>Bench:</b> Built into the interface, platform where user situates themselves</li>
        <li><b>Rack:</b> The structure of the interface, bolted to the ground to offer stability, hooks to hold the bar in resting position</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Questions About Interface</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What do you find intuitive about the bench press?</li>
        <li>What do you find unintuitive about the bench press?</li>
        <li>Do you use the bench press alone or with other people?</li>
        <li>Does your user experience change based on what time/day you use the bench press?</li>
        <li>Do social norms influence how you interact with the bench press?</li>    
    </ul>

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <div class = "underline">Key Observations</div>
    <p>
        Users begin interacting with the interface by adding little to no weight to the bar. As they
        perform more repetitions, they increased the amount of weight. Once finished with using the 
        bench press, users transferred weight from the bar back to the plate holders, manually
        resetting the interface for the next user.

    <div class = "underline">Summary of Questions</div>
    <ul>
        <li><em>What do you find intuitive about the bench press?</em></li>
        Users agreed that the simplicity and popularity of the bench press made it easy to use. 
            Unlike some other exercise interfaces in the gym, the bench press has relatively few moving parts.
        <li><em>What do you find unintuitive about the bench press?</em></li>
        
        <li><em>Do you use the bench press alone or with other people?</em></li>
        Some perform the exercise together with a workout buddy, while others tend to use the interface individually.
        However, all parties acknowledged the benefit of having a "spotter", an indiviudal who can help the bench presser
        safely complete their exercise.
        <li><em>Does your user experience change based on what time/day you use the bench press?</em></li>
        <li><em>Do social norms influence how you interact with the bench press?</em></li>    
    </ul>
